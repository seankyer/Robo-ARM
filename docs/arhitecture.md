# High Level Architecture of Project

1. [] BLE Connectivity
2. [] Path finding algorithm
3. [] Servo Driver
4. [] Servo PWM
5. [] LEGO matt with Servo stage

## BLE Connectivity
Will take advantage of Zephyr BLE Host stack

## Path Finding
tbd.

## Servo Driver
1. go_to_angle() API
2. Homing/Auto-calibrate routine/method

## Servo PWM
Using device-tree overlay, assign pin-out from nrf52840dk to servo
